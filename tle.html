<H1>Welcome, TLE Visitors</H1>
I built this page rather quickly (and in 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</A>, no less),
so please forgive its spartan nature.

<H3>The Books</H3>
<P>You may be wondering why books like Leading Change and Let's Get Real are
on our lis of references, when they don't really deal with systems
development, use cases or SOA.
Our experience is that much of the battle is organizational change and
selling the client on the value of the solution.
Kotter's seminal work is the best we know about creating lasting and
useful change in an organization. 
Khalsa's Let's Get Real is the only book that I've seen that truly
informs its readers how to ensure a win-win sales situation in collaboration
with your client.

<P>The remaining books on use cases and Rational's Unified Process are
supplemented by the links below.</P>
