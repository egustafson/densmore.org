<H3>1956 Cessna 180 Owners Manual</H3>
<P>
Well, y'all know that
<A HREF="http://www.densmore.org/personal/55A">I own a 1956
Cessna 180, serial 32452</A>,
originally with an O470-K Continental engine (it has an -R now).
Whatcha don't know is since my Dad bought it in 1960 he took such
amazingly good care of the original owner manual that I still
have it, can still use it, can still read it.
Now, I'm not going to show you the whole thing, but here are a
few nuggets from it.
</P>
<P>
This manual is kinda special, because my Mom learned to fly power
aircraft in the 180 in the '60s.
Dad has very few notes in this book, but Mom has lots.
I can easily tell the difference in their handwriting.
So this is a very personal book for me.
</P>
<P>
I'm cheap, and I write most of my pages in
<A HREF="http://www.vim.org">vi</A>,
so to get to the previous page, go &lt;back&gt; -
and to get back to here from one of these
scanned images, please do the same.

        (491k),
        this appears to be a repeat of the cover.  There is another
	photo in the manual that is very very similar, but it's not
	quite the same photo as this one.</TD>
