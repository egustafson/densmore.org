<LI>Routing for mail to the densmore.org address depends on DNS routing

    While extremely dependable, this service is not commercial,
    and may occasionally be down for some reason.
    If so, well, then please be patient!  It will be back.

    A bit of a joke went around for awhile about how many email
    addresses one has, but I don't wanna bore you.
    These all go to the same place -- me.
    Since
    <font color=#0033aa><U><I>&lt;anything not
	recognized&gt;</I>(at)densmore.org</U></font>
    comes to me whether I like it or not, I, like many domain managers,
    have nearly a
    <A
    HREF="http://www.mathacademy.com/pr/minitext/infinity">countable infinity</A>
    of addresses that route to me!
    Of course, these days, lots of addresses to which I get spam <i>are</i>
    recognized - and automatically thrown into the bit bucket.
    I never see them.

    What's with the "<B>(at)</B>" instead of "<B>@</B>"?
    Well, with all the automated spammers and email sifters on the internet,
    I've found that this simple hack dramatically reduces the amount of spam
    that I get.
    Sorry you have to change the <B>(at)</B> to <B>@</B> manually -
    a price we pay for a free and open net, and a small price at that.
