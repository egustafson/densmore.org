  <B>San Jose Tower</B>: <FONT color="002266">"American 751, make a hard right turn at the end of the runway, if you are able. If you are not able, take the Guadeloupe exit off Highway 101, make a right at the lights and return to the airport."</FONT>

  A Pan Am 727 flight, waiting for start clearance in Munich , overheard the following:  <BR>
  <B>Lufthansa (in German)</B>: <FONT color="002266">" Ground, what is our start clearance time?"</FONT>  <BR>
  <B>Ground (in English)</B>: <FONT color="002266">"If you want an answer you must speak in English."</FONT>  <BR>
  <B>Lufthansa (in English)</B>: <FONT color="002266">"I am a German, flying a German airplane, in Germany . Why must I speak English?"</FONT>  <BR>

One day the pilot of a Cherokee 180 was told by the tower to hold short of the active runway while a DC-8 landed. The DC-8 landed, rolled out, turned around, and taxied back past the Cherokee. Some quick-witted <B>comedian in the DC-8 crew</B> got on the radio and said, <FONT color="002266">"What a cute little plane. Did you make it all by yourself?"</FONT>  <BR>
<P>  <B>The Cherokee pilot</B>, not about to let the insult go by, came back with a real zinger: <FONT color="002266">"I made it out of DC-8 parts. Another landing like yours and I'll have enough parts for another one."</FONT>

The German air controllers at Frankfurt Airport are renowned as a short-tempered lot. They not only expect one to know one's gate parking location, but how to get there without any assistance from them. So it was with some amusement that we (a Pan Am 747) listened to the following exchange between Frankfurt ground control and a British Airways 747, call sign Speedbird 206.  <P>
  <B>Speedbird 206</B>: <FONT color="002266">" Frankfurt , Speedbird 206! clear of active runway."</FONT>  <BR>
  <B>Ground</B>: <FONT color="002266">"Speedbird 206. Taxi to gate Alpha One-Seven."</FONT>  <BR>
The BA 747 pulled onto the main taxiway and slowed to a stop.  <BR>

  <B>Ground</B>: <FONT color="002266">"Speedbird, do you not know where you are going?"</FONT>  <BR>
  <B>Speedbird 206</B>: <FONT color="002266">"Stand by, Ground, I'm looking up our gate location now."</FONT>  <BR>
  <B>Ground (with quite arrogant impatience)</B>: <FONT color="002266">"Speedbird 206, have you not been to Frankfurt before?"</FONT>  <BR>
  <B>Speedbird 206 (coolly)</B>: <FONT color="002266">"Yes, twice in 1944, but it was dark, -- And I didn't land."</FONT>

  While taxiing at London's Gatwick Airport , the crew of a US Air flight departing for Ft. Lauderdale made a wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727. An irate <B>female ground controller</B> lashed out at the US Air crew, screaming: <FONT color="002266">"US Air 2771, where the hell are you going? I told you to turn right onto Charlie taxiway! You turned right on Delta! Stop right there. I know it's difficult for you to tell the difference between C and D, but get it right!"</FONT> 
</P>
<P>
  Continuing her rage to the embarrassed crew, she was now shouting hysterically: <FONT color="002266">"God! Now you've screwed everything up! It 'll take forever to sort this out! You stay right there and don't move till I tell you to! You can expect progressive taxi instructions in about half an hour, and I want you to go exactly where I tell you, when I tell you, and how I tell you! You got that, US Air 2771?"</FONT> 
</P>
<P>
<FONT color="002266">"Yes, ma'am,"</FONT> the humbled crew responded. 
</P>
<P>
  Naturally, the ground control communications frequency fell terribly silent after the verbal bashing of US Air 2771. Nobody wanted to chance engaging the irate ground controller in her current state of mind. Tension in every cockpit out around Gatwick was definitely running high. Just then <B>an unknown pilot</B> broke the silence and keyed his microphone, asking: <FONT color="002266">"Wasn't I married to you once?"</FONT>
