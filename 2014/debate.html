A colleague made reference to
<A HREF="http://www.iflscience.com/99999-certainty-humans-are-driving-global-warming-new-study">this link</A> as one of the better
studies on anthropogenic climate change. </P>
<P>
So I started with the abstract. To wit, below, with (n) annotations to 
indicate where in the abstract I make comment in the notes following:</P>
<P>
December 2013 was the 346th consecutive month where global land and ocean average surface temperature exceeded the 20th century monthly average, with February 1985 the last time mean temperature fell below this value. Even given these and other extraordinary statistics
<BR>(1)</BR>
, public acceptance of human induced climate change and confidence in the supporting science has declined since 2007. The degree of uncertainty as to whether observed climate changes are due to human activity or are part of natural systems fluctuations remains a major stumbling block to effective adaptation action and risk management. 
<BR>(2)</BR>
Previous approaches to attribute change include qualitative expert-assessment approaches such as used in IPCC reports and use of 'fingerprinting' methods based on global climate models. Here we develop an alternative approach which provides a rigorous probabilistic statistical assessment of the link between observed climate changes and human activities in a way that can inform formal climate risk assessment. 
<BR>(3)</BR>
We construct and validate a time series model of anomalous global temperatures to June 2010, using rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as other causal factors including solar radiation, volcanic forcing and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. When the effect of GHGs is removed, bootstrap simulation of the model

reveals that there is less than a one in one hundred thousand chance 
<BR>(5)</BR>
of observing an unbroken sequence of 304 months (our analysis extends to June 2010) with mean surface temperature exceeding the 20th century average. We also show that one would expect a far greater number of short periods of falling global temperatures (as observed since 1998) if climate change was not occurring. This approach to assessing probabilities of human influence on global temperature could be transferred to other climate variables and extremes allowing enhanced formal risk assessment of climate change.

<P>== == == == == == </P>
<P>Here are the five notes I have regarding this abstract. It is followed by my
conclusions. </P>
<P>
(1) unclear why this statistic was chosen, but this is a false assertion. In the first sentence, a false assertion, think about it. There is absolutely nothing extraordinary about the fact that 346 months have gone by without the temperatures falling below the 20th Century monthly average. Nothing. In Earth's history it has happened a gazillion times. As a mathematician myself, I can tell you with certainty that this dramatic statement is a mathematically trivial fact. 
</P>
<P>
(2) Another false assertion. There is no uncertainty. Observed climate changes ARE, in part, due to human activity. There is no doubt of this. It is a certainty. What is not certain is the degree to which human activity is the cause, not that it is at least a partial cause. Also the degree to which we can affect outcomes, and the economic impact of doing so, which the paper fails to address.
</P>
<P>
(3) They're trying to institutionalize the assertion that correlation proves cause. This is truly outlandish. It is not science. These people have advanced degrees in climate science and they have the audacity to call this science. Any idiot can reason out that they aren't proving anything with this study. I'm sorry, but this is complete drivel.
</P>
<P>
(4) There are a number of articles out there shredding the models. The models are doing a terrible job predicting anything; they're really quite horrible. Moreover, this article presumes that there cannot be some other cause for the warming. There are many, many articles out there proposing other causes for the fact that warming is occurring. 
These "scientists" have to conveniently ignore these proposals to make these conclusions.
</P>
<P>
(5) Only if the presumption - not proven here unfortunately - is true that there is no other cause for the warming. Also, I point out that this article fails to account for the data indicating that the average temperatures have not been increasing for the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: just from the abstract to this article it is clear that these
supposed scientists are not acting in a scientific manner.
This is very unfortunate and further reduces the public's ability to trust
scientists, except of course for those people who don't understand the scientific
method well enough to understand the situation.
I trust science. But I do not trust scientists any more.
Too many of them are drawing conclusions based on their agenda instead of science.
The paper proves nothing. It doesn't improve the odds of anything.
This is very sad.
