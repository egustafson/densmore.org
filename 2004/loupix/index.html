I had the great fortune of visiting Judy in the latter part of June.
While visiting her I was given a chance to take a few pictures in Lou's office.
There is a scale model of Old Charlie, but it's not in very good condition at
the moment (it got dusted :-) so I neglected to take a picture of it.</P>
<P>
Some pictures follow.  Click on a thumb for larger.
I have these in "large" mode, about 3MB apiece, let me know by email
(jim at densmore.org) if you would like any.
Non-commercial purposes only, and please respect Lou and Judy's privacy
of course.</P>
<P>
Here are four pictures of the models in his office.
The thing that makes these models cool is that they are all the exact
same scale; 1/72 is the scale if I correctly recall.
There even is some interest in accepting the donation of these models as a group;
the interest comes from the Virginia Aviation Historical Society.
I hope that works out. </P>
<P>
The Vega and its neighbor, a Sirius, come from the same kit.
Lou wrote an article about creating the Sirius in a modeler magazine.
He bought two Vega kits and was able to create the Sirius from them.
(You may recall that Jack Northrop designed both the two aircraft while at
Lockheed in Hollywood, prior to their move to Burbank.)
Way cool.</P>

Here are some pictures of the famous Spitfire gunsight.
The power supply was not attached and I didn't know where it was,
but I assure you, it works when you flip the switch. </P>

Lou also owned a very interesting Bendix sextant.
Here are a few pictures of it.
Does anyone know what set of aircraft this sextant might have come from?</P>
