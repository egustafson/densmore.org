Random photos, mostly from our visit to Scripps during Parents Weekend.
I've tried to keep all the photos under 500KB in size, there are a couple
that are just over that.
The originals are almost 3MB in size, so the camera can really crank up the
resolution.

The rare books section of the library, the decor is warm and pleasant as you can see.

This introduces a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible that is kept in the Rare Books section of the Scripps Library.  Photos of the leaf follow.  They were very nice about photos, even allowed flash.  The students can come in and genuinely touch some impressive books.

Over Halloween the girls painstakingly paste eyes on the flowers.  Funny.  This one eye remains from last Halloween. <P>

I was in Seal Court.  Got up on the ledge and pointed the camera down.  It looked like a good shot so I took it.  Look closely, you can see the large orange fish in the pond.

Impressive threatre refurbishment.  The old seats were removed, refurbished and replaced.  They were willing to buy new seats but could not, at any price, find seats that were as robust and comfortable as those originally in the theatre.

One of several murals in the theatre lobby.
