My father died in November, 2006.
Mostly because I can, I guess, I've posted a few memories, a
few stories that might interest some of you.
The beauty of the internet is that if no one is interested, then
they simply won't get read.
But I enjoyed the memories that flooded my mind while writing them,
and if it was good only for my own soul, that is good enough.

Dad had <A HREF="dadspage/index.html">a website</A> that
I was hosting at my Earthlink location.
I have moved it and am posting that website
<A HREF="dadspage/index.html">here at densmore.org</A>
in case anyone would like to read some of it.
His exposition of
<A HREF="dadspage/How_Things_Fly.html">why airplanes fly</A>
is one of the best and simplest explanations I've seen.
Dad had a Professional Degree from <A HREF="http://www.caltech.edu">Caltech</A>
  in Aeronautical Engineering (this is a Ph.D. sans the language requirement)
  so I guess he ought to have known what he was talking about!
I hope you like it.
