<P>
My two daughters were interested in visiting several colleges in New
York and Maryland.
A long commute if you happen to live in Colorado Springs as we do, so I
contacted my parents in Southern Maryland and hatched a wonderful plan.
By their graciousness, we would borrow Dad's Cessna 180, enabling us to
make short work of the college campus visits and we would get to see
some other relatives as well.
</P>
<P>
We traveled to Maryland by airline, flew the 180 up to the several
colleges in New York, culminating in a landing at Allentown PA for a
three-day visit to New York City.
A closer destination was planned but the weather wasn't cooperating
that day.
Without an instrument rating, Allentown became the clear choice.
Besides, it just isn't that far from the City.
</P>
<P>
We finished our college visit in the City on the first day.
As I sipped a glass of wine over lunch on the second day, we marveled
at our good fortune, the beauty of New York, and the sites we were
planning to see before our departure the following afternoon.
As luck would have it, though, the weather would once again interfere
with our plans.
Leaving the restaurant I glanced at a TV monitor and saw from a weather
map that I needed to check the weather again for our trip the following day.
It quickly became clear that a late evening departure would be necessary
to ensure that we would be able to get home to our airline flights three
days away.
</P>
<P>
I started my stopwatch.
Only one small glass, but eight hours must pass first.
And I would need to make two landings to become night current before our
departure.
It would be a late night.
We called my parents to let them know we would be coming in late and
played New York tourist for the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
We arrived at Allentown with 20 minutes to go on my watch.
I checked weather one last time and preflighted the airplane.
My wife turned the car in and the girls settled down in front of the
FBO television.
I taxied out, performed my two full stop landings, and returned to the ramp.
I used the cell phone to call Dad with the final plan.
He assured me the car would be waiting at the airport.
We loaded up and departed.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling was already down to 3000 feet, but it was smooth and clear
underneath.
At midnight the frequencies began to quiet, and soon we were over the
Chesapeake Bay.
At the urging of Potomac Approach we crossed over to the west coast of the
Bay and into his Class B airspace at the Bridge.
No one's around at that time of night, so we had his airspace to ourselves.
I looked back.
Both my girls were asleep in the still night.
My wife and I took in the view of the Washington lights from our magic
chariot, our dependable 180 that Dad wrangled away from a United Airlines
pilot back in the spring of 1960.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 1am, the power plant came into view signaling time to turn
away from the Bay.
The beacon at St. Mary's blinked faithfully at us, and I keyed the mic to
turn on the runway lights.
Shortly after I did so, two extra lights came into view.
What are those, I wondered?
Oh.
Headlights on a car, on the taxi way midfield.
It was Dad.
Immediately I knew this.
Too worried - no, not too worried, too caring to sleep.
</P>
<P>
Overhead now, I called my position, rolled into a tight pattern, slowed
to 75 mph, and with only a little bounce stalled our dear 180 onto the runway.
Before we turned onto the midfield taxiway the lights turned and he guided
us down the taxiway.
We arrived at a portion of the taxiway I had not realized was unlit that
led to our hangar.
The car's presence made finding our way much easier.
</P>
<P>
The hangar doors were open.
Few words were said as we pushed the airplane into its den and moved the
baggage into the car.
But no warmer feeling would I entertain than that night, knowing I and my
family were in good hands.
