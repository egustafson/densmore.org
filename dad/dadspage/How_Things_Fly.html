             Many wonder, since air is invisible, how it can support an airplane. 
    &nbsp;Even   though it is invisible, air is stuff. &nbsp;There are many 
  examples.  &nbsp;Feel   the wind and watch the wind blow snow, leaves and 
  trees, and  the stuff that   is air becomes more apparent. &nbsp;The terrible 
  distruction  of hurricanes   and tornadoes is tragically clear evidence 
that  air contains  alot of stuff,   stuff that can apply a great deal of 
pressure,  easily enough  to lift an airplace.<br>
<br>
             There are many explanations of How Airplanes Fly in books, museums,
      flying    lesson material and other sources. &nbsp;Most rely on the
relation       between    fluid velocity and fluid pressure given many years
ago (in   1738)    by Daniel    Bernoulli. &nbsp;That relation is of fundamental
importance     in  aeronautics    and is called Bernoulli's Theorem. &nbsp;Important
 in   an explanation  of  flight,  Bernoulli's Theorem states that: where
the velocity   is higher,  the pressure  is smaller; and where the velocity
is lower, the   pressure is  larger.<br>
<br>
                      Since the velocity above the wing is higher than the
 velocity     below    the   wing, it follows directly from Bernoulli's Theorem
 that  airplane   wings   provide   lift. &nbsp;Most explanations rely on
this relation  to  explain  how things   fly. &nbsp;Where many have difficulty 
 is in explaining    why the  velocity is  higher above the wing then below 
 the wing.<br>
<br>
                      For example, several Federal Agencies have presented
 in  flying    lesson    material  that the velocity is higher on the top
of the  wing because,   for    an airfoil  shape, the air particles have
further to go to match up  at the   trailing edge  with particles on the
bottom of the wing and therefore  they   must go faster.  &nbsp;<i>It is
well established   that the air particles   do  not match up at  the trailing
edge.</i> &nbsp;If   they did, how could  an airplane  fly upside down, as
is often seen at air   shows. &nbsp;Unfortunately,    there  are also a number
of other less-than-correct    explanations.<br>
<br>
<u>Why is the velocity above the wing higher than below the wing?</u><br>
<br>
                      To explain why the velocity is higher above the wing
 than   below,    it  may   help to recollect some common observations. &nbsp;When 
   rowing  a  boat  or paddling  a canoe one often notices the swirls that 
 the  oars or paddles  make in the  water. &nbsp;These swirls occur off the 
 relatively  sharp edge  of the oar or paddle.<br>
<br>
                      When fluid flow, air or water, is around a relatively 
 sharp    edge,    or  even   when two different flow rates meet, swirls or
 VORTICES    form.  &nbsp;It   is  an important natural phenomenon. Similarly 
 a vortex    is formed  by the  sharp  trailing edge of an airfoil. &nbsp;This 
 vortex   is termed the  starting  vortex.<br>
<br>
                      Since every action has an equal and opposite re-action, 
  when   a  vortex    starts,  behind an airfoil, the equal and opposite reaction
   is a vortex  in  the opposite  direction around the airfoil. &nbsp;Thus,
  there  are two  velocities  that affect  the pressure on the airfoil: 1)
 the velocity  of the airfoil through the air,  and 2) the vortex or circulation
  around the airfoil. &nbsp;Above  an airfoil,  the velocity through the
air   and the circulation  are in the same direction  and are additive. Below
the  airfoil the circulation  is subtracted  from the  velocity through the
air.  &nbsp;Consequently, above  the airfoil  the velocity  is higher and,
from  Bernoulli's Theorem, the pressure  is lower.  &nbsp;Below  the airfoil
there  is a lower velocity and higher pressure. &nbsp;The  pressure  differential
  produces lift. &nbsp;The  lift is proportional to the  velocity  through
 the air and the magnitude of the circulation. &nbsp;The  circulation increases
  with the angle of attack  of the airfoil.<br>

                      The precise mathematical relationships of lift were 
worked    out   in  the   early  1900's by the German mathematician Kutta 
and the  Russian    scientist    Joukowsky.  &nbsp;Each developed the math 
independently  of  the  other and   the relationship  is known as the Kutta-Joukowsky 
Law.  &nbsp;Kutta    assumed   that the circulation  strength around the airfoil
 is just sufficient    to result   in the flow streaming  smoothly off both
 the upper and lower   surfaces and   leaving the airfoil at  the trailing
 edge. &nbsp;Although  he could not give   a physical explanation,  experiment
 shows that his assumption    accurately  corresponds to reality. &nbsp;Some
  years later, in 1918, the    German physicist  Prandtl gave a complete
description.<br>
<br>
                      Without going into detail, theory and visual flow observations
      both   confirm   that the starting vortex detaches from the airfoil.
 &nbsp;The     airfoil  vortex   is connected to the starting vortex by two
 trailing vortices,    one  from each   wing tip. Visualization of this vortex
 pattern is important    to  pilots in  avoiding vortices of other airplanes,
 particularly larger   ones.<br>

                      Trailing vortices are usually referred to as Wake Turbulence
     by  pilots.     &nbsp;They are potentially dangerous, particularly when
   the  wake  of a larger    airplane is encountered by a smaller airplane.
  &nbsp;The  vortices  are usually    invisible and have caused fatal accidents.
  &nbsp;Business  jets encountering    the wake of an airliner have been
unable   to stop rolling  even with full  opposite  controls. &nbsp;To reduce
the  hazard during takeoff  and landing  approach,  air traffic controllers
increase  the separation distance    behind  heavy airplanes.<br>

                Note: &nbsp;"How Airplanes Fly" briefly describes the aerodynamics
     known  and  practiced by Aeronautical Engineers. &nbsp;I have a Masters
   Degree  and  Professional Degree in Aeronautical &nbsp;Engineering from
 the  California   Institute of Technology. &nbsp;I learned and practiced
these  same principles,   did research in aeronautics and helped design advanced
   airplanes that flew.   &nbsp;<br>
