   Here's a little legacy for you.
   This is my Dad's website, which I have moved onto
    the densmore.org server here.
   Partly because of Mom's experience as a docent at the
    <A HREF="http://www.nasm.si.edu">National Air and Space Museum</A>,
    Dad was very interested in providing a simple, thorough and
    correct treatise online on how airplanes fly.
   Have you always felt that the existing descriptions of flight don't
    seem to make sense?
   Well, often they don't!
   Many ideas about flight are just not factually correct.
</P>
<P>
   So, late in life, Dad set out to write a correct and simple description.
   You'll find it here, along with a few other items you'll enjoy if
   you knew him.
   He didn't finish the information on supersonic flight, which is a
   shame because much of his early research was on supersonic flight,
   but you will see here also what he started authoring.
   I'm still looking for the image he intended to use.
</P>
<P>
   So that you will know your author better, I've added three
   pictures at the end of this page.
   Please enjoy this, one of my Dad's last works.</P>
