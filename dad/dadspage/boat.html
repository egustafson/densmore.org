   When we retired in Southern Maryland, we started looking for a boat. &nbsp; 
 We had rented a Sabre 30 sail boat for two weeks for several years, and enjoyed
 the Chesapeake Bay. &nbsp;We started looking for a power boat since we were
 older and handling the sails had become a bit of a chore. &nbsp;Trident Yachts
 in Solomon's Island at Zanhiser's Yachting Center found the perfect boat
for  us, a Mainship 34 with a Perkins 165 HP diesel engine, electric galley
and  quiet auxiliary generator. &nbsp;She was previously owned by a couple
living  in Dallas, TX, who named her "Blue Bonnet". &nbsp;Now, we have nothing
against  Texans, but we are not one of them, so we changed the name to Adagio.
&nbsp;Adagio is an Italian musical term meaning to play this passage slow
and easy, and that is our boat. &nbsp;She cruises at 9 knots when the prop
is clean, using 3 gallons per hour of fuel. &nbsp;She sleeps 2, feeds 4,
cocktails 6 and is a very comfortable "live aboard" boat. &nbsp;However she
pitches and/or rolls a lot in waves over 2 feet - rather uncomfortable  for
many older people, but safe. &nbsp;So we wait for a forecast of waves  one-foot
or less before crossing the Bay. &nbsp;<br>
   <br>
 We  like to watch the wild life on the Patuxent River and in the many beautiful 
 coves on the Eastern shore of the Bay, especially in or off the Miles, Wye, 
 Choptank and Chester rivers. &nbsp;Our favorite places to re-supply and eat
 out are St. Michaels, Oxford, Rock Hall, Chestertown and occasionally Annapolis.<br>
