<small><small><small><br>
At sub-sonic speeds, the air in front of an airplane is put into motion
by pressure changes that propagate ahead at the speed of sound.
&nbsp;At supersonic
speeds the air ahead does not receive pressure changes because the
airplane
is traveling faster than its own pressure waves. &nbsp;Therefore the
flow
around a wing is quite different but still results in a net higher
pressure
below the airfoil than above it.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The supersonic passage of an airplane causes shock
waves
where the air is abruptly pushed aside to allow the passage of the
airplane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pressure and temperature
of air passing through a shock wave is abruptly increased and the air
velocity
is decreased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the air has room to
expand, there are expansion waves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
characteristics of expansion waves are opposite to shock waves.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The pressure and temperature of air passing
through an expansion wave is abruptly decreased and the air velocity is
increased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The diagram of a
double-wedge airfoil (Fig. 1) portrays a supersonic wave pattern at an
angle of
attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The solid lines are shock waves
and the dashed lines are expansion waves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pressure on top of the airfoil, behind the leading edge
expansion
wave is decreased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the bottom,
behind the leading edge shock wave, the air undergoes high compression,
which
increases the pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pressure
along the top and bottom of the airfoil is plotted in Fig. 2.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are many shock waves from a supersonic
airplane, but
they usually interact and coalesce into two main shocks &#8211; one from the
front
and the other from the rear of the airplane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They gradually diverge due to a slight difference in propagation
speed
and usually an observer hears a double sonic boom.</p>
