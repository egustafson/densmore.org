About a year ago (as this is written in January 2015) I visited my Mother
at her home in Solomons, as I try to do as frequently as possible despite
that we live in Colorado.
Her home is part of a collection of apartments where care is graduated
depending on need, and it caters to our senior citizens.
I often ponder the stories her neighbors have to tell.
</P>
<P>
During our visit, we shared a meal with a couple whose company I greatly
enjoyed.
In particular, the gentleman had been "prepped" by my Mom that I was
interested in WWII aviation.
He did have a wealth of stories.
But he did better than that!
He gave me a copy of some of the stories he has written for the Asbury
Solomons newsletter.
I asked Mr. Garner if it would be okay for me to post this booklet on the
internet, and he said that would be very nice.
I certainly think so - it honors our greatest generation.
</P>
<P>Therefore, I have scanned in this booklet of some 15 pages for y'all.
My scanner software isn't known for its compaction algorithms, the booklet
in
<A HREF="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">pdf</A>
is over 13 megabytes, so apologies if it takes a minute to
<A HREF="garner/Vernon Garner booklet.pdf">download</A>.
Please read on, and let me know if you enjoyed it.
