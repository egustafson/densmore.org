<P>
Hi, <A HREF="index.html">here's my post</A> of the pictures I took at the conference meet.
If you wish a full-size picture, please let me know at the email
address above.
These photos are at 800x800 resolution.
The full-size photos are much larger, 3072x3072 maximum.
However, they take up 15mb total, so I did not post them full-size.
</P>
<P>If you <A HREF="mailto:jim-at-densmore.org">email me</A> (gotta change the -at- to @ - I do
this for security/spam reasons) looking for full-size photos, please let me know how
you would like to receive them, and be sure to name each photo you wish.
Some are usefully named, but some are just named for the chronological
order in which they are taken, particularly later on after I got tired!
</P>
<P>I will be happy to snail-mail you a CD if you wish a lot of photos.
Just let me know.
<A HREF="mailto:meg-at-densmore.org">Meg</A> has access to a CD also that I gave to one of her teammates.
(Never underestimate the bandwidth of a mailed CD!)
Enjoy!!  Go Cards.  --Jim
