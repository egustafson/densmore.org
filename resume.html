<P>
Member of the SM&amp;A Software Engineering Process Group.
Developed for this group a software process and management requirements
document for SM&amp;A ITSG.
This document represents a first cut at a formal development and
management process for SM&amp;A, and indicates SM&amp;A's interest in
reducing software development risk and increasing software quality using
practices that emphasize a robust architecture, increase predictability
and correctness through constant, automated testing practices and measure
results to ensure an understanding of process cause-and-effect relationships.
While stressing software architecture, quality and process predictability
as the major goals, the document highlights the importance of risk
management and mitigation through identification and prioritization,
disciplined iterative development including end-of-iteration testing,
and constant design refactoring using fully automated regression testing
procedures.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Assumed technical leadership role in a variety of short-term consulting
and outsourcing contracts with several Vsys telephony customers.
A principal consulting goal was to improve our customers' process by
applying architecture- centric, controlled iterative and object-oriented
development process techniques to their product development efforts.
Specific technologies included formal requirements documentation and
tracking, system modeling and development, iterative automated testing
procedures using a class-test design pattern, object-oriented
programming languages, distributed object management, and object database
technology to permit uniform, high-performance object persistence.
Co-developer of a new prototype product called VSwitch(TM) that marries
IN and VoIP technologies, making possible a large number of new product
lines in the IP telephony market.
<P>
Contracted to Fast Product Development Group at MCI.
Assumed group technical leadership role, including architectural
specification and object-oriented database systems development
responsibilities.
Significantly improved market response time by applying object-oriented
analysis and development technologies to MCI's next generation telephone
call processing systems, including a multi-phase freephone translation
system for British Telecom that will eventually include a network-based
virtual call center for BT's largest commercial customers.
Specific technologies included object-oriented analysis and design
techniques, object-oriented languages, and OO DBMS.
Successfully fielded MCI's first real-time object-oriented call
routing system, for which there are patents pending.

<LI>Participated in the development of advanced O-O target tracking software,
including demonstration of a prototype with live FAA/ICAO flight plan
processing.
This resulted in the Domestic Air Interdiction Capability product for U.S.
Customs.
<LI>Directed DSA marketing and customer support activities on the West
Coast, particularly those relating to TAC BRAWLER, the flagship example
of DSA's simulation technology developed for the U.S. Air Force.
<LI>Directed the development installation and support of real-time
intelligent adversary software for the Lockheed Weapon Systems Simulation
Center Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) man-in-the-loop
full-mission air combat simulator, designed to train Air Force fighter
pilots in the use of Lockheed's F-22 in combat situations.
Based on TAC BRAWLER, the installed adversary software drove Soviet and
other adversary aircraft.
The software controlled and responded to all critical aircraft
systems including flight controls and the avionics suite, and was
given high marks for realism in a variety of small- and medium-sized
combat engagement simulations.
<LI>Many other activities over an eighteen year period.
Instrumental in the continuing development of engagement level combat
simulations utilizing DSA's "value-driven" and "information oriented"
artificial intelligence architectures, which permit sensitivity to the
crucial human elements of innovative cooperative tactics, C3, and surprise
&amp; confusion.
