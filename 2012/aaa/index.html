Hi folks!
I have <A HREF="movies/index.html">movies</A> and I have
<A HREF="photos/index.html">photos</A>.
The <A HREF="movies/index.html">movies</A> aren't too long so I should
put them up on youTube but I have not yet done that.
</P>
<P>
I have over 300 <A HREF="photos/index.html">photos</A> that I worked through.
In the end I have posted 136 here; probably too many and I'll bore you, but the
<A HREF="http://jalbum.net/en">JAlbum</A> photo presenter makes it easy
to look at thumbs until you see one you'd like to see larger.
As you will see, I tended to focus on these topics:
<UL>
    <LI>A few airplanes with which I was completely enthralled (Bleriot,
	Trimotor, Boeing 40C) </LI>
    <LI>People operating their aircraft </LI>
    <LI>Unusual elements - the moonshine (not the liquor variety, though I
	did get to taste some!), rubber chickens, landing lights, etc. </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
A few of the photos have received very minor photoshop treatment - a crop
here, a little more contrast there (cloudy days suck for photography!).
Most of them, however, are not retouched.
I hope you enjoy my images even half as much as I enjoyed the thrill of
being there and taking them, and seeing all your gorgeous airplanes.
</P>

Below is a photo of Eric Presten's 1909 Bleriot.
It's a faithful replica though constructed of modern materials.
The engine is a 1930s radial - the original engine just isn't very safe.
This is the first time a wing warping aircraft has ever operated from
<A HREF="http://www.antiqueairfield.com">Antique Aerodrome</A>.
Eric didn't just hop it either.
In the very early morning, still air, he took it around the pattern!
It was a wonderful privilege to see a piece of history like this fly.
