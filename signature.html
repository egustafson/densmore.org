<H4>Pithy signature items</H4>

For your amusement, these are some of the things I've considered appending
to my email signature over the years, and then usually thought better of.
My email signature is normally devoid of any pithy statements.
I have learned over the years that <I>Everybody Sells</I>, and that is as
it should be, so my signature already contains plenty of stuff.
Thus, every time I try to put something pithy in there like so many others
do, it just makes the signature longer than I want.
So I put some of them here instead.  Enjoy ...

	 Thanks to <A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-dunnavant-7b4920">Todd Dunnavant</A>
	 for suggesting this idea.
	 As a simple google search quickly showed, it was not necessary
	 to program this up.
	 Someone (several someones) already had done it.
	 By the way, one of my all-time favorite fortunes was provided to me
	 recently by Brad Spencer at Eldar.org.
	 There's an additional story around it, but it is too lengthy to
	 describe here.

	<FONT color="004400">Half-done: <BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the best way to eat a kosher dill -- when it's
	still crunchy, light green, yet full of garlic flavor.  The difference
	between this and the typical soggy dark green cucumber corpse is like
	the difference between life and death. <BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; You may find it difficult to find a good half-done kosher dill
	there in Seattle, so what you should do is take a cab out to the
	airport, fly to New York, take the JFK Express to Jay Street-Borough
	Hall, transfer to an uptown F, get off at East Broadway, walk north on
	Essex (along the park), make your first left onto Hester Street, walk
	about fifteen steps, turn ninety degrees left, and stop.  Say to the
	man, "Let me have a nice half-done."  <BR>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Worth the trouble, wasn't it? </FONT> <BR>
