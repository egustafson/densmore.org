<H2>Introduction </H2>
This information is for the January 2016 Skywagon Breakfast fly-in to 
Goodland, Kansas. 
Host arrival time: about 8am.
Breakfast: about 9am, we're relaxed, whenever you get there!
btw ... Goodland is on MOUNTAIN Std Time; all times herein are MST.
(We have scheduled two rain-date Saturdays after the primary date because,
after all, it is January on the Front Range and Kansas.
The weather could suck.)
<P>

I want to be able to warn the restaurant if we have lots of people coming.
Please include when you plan to arrive, and how many are
in your party! Thanks!

<H2>Flyout Info </H2>
If you would be interested in visiting the aircraft museum in Pueblo, CO
after breakfast, please let me know.
<P>
(PS: I had heard that Pueblo's fine airport restaurant had closed.
More recently I heard that it was only closed temporarily, for renovation.
I was able to verify that last weekend, in fact that restaurant opened
for business following renovation on Monday 11 January, at 0700.
Its new name is Aviators Bar and Grill.)
