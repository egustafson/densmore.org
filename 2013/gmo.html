      Whole Foods says they're going to label all GMO foods.
      Hopefully this article makes clear that is <I>anything</I>
      containing corn products.

      This interesting article basically says jury's out, and points out
      the essential <I>innovation</I> aspects. 
      I am <I>always</I> concerned when we stifle innovation.

      This ppt from Alan McHughen of UC Riverside documents one of my major concerns, that much
      of the fuss about GMO might be simple fearmongering, and not science.
      It is easy today to decide something is bad based on the chaotic
      internet.  Much harder to learn the truth.  Most of the articles that
      I am finding about GMO - especially those telling you it is bad -
      contain lots of assertions but no science backing up the assertions.
      Thus, they could be true, or false - who's to know?
      Between slides 32 and 36 we find how little cause there is for worry,
      at least in the
      <A HREF="https://www.google.com/search?q=alan+mchughen%2C+UCR&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">expert opinion</A>
      of this person.
      Is there some cause for worry?  Of course.  There
      is <I>always</I> risk.  I'm doing my best to manage risk and cost and
      benefit together.  If we find out more, and it's all adverse, that 
      would be ample reason to reconsider.

      I liked this article in the Washington Post.  They're not always very
      balanced.  This article is.  Basically, to me, it says Manage the Risk.
      One must always manage risk.  We do not have the right to live in a
      risk-free environment, nor would I wish to.

      Here is a classic example of my concern about unscientific information.
      There are lots of statistics in this article, but I did not find any
      that actually
      address the important assertions they subsequently made about safety
      and risk, such as  "GMO's
      are a huge threat to both our farmers and our health."  This quote is not
      backed up <I>at all</I> in the article, at least not that I found.
      When I see an article like this with lots of stats but none or very
      few backing up the important assertions,
      I look for motivation.  These guys appear to make their money when
      you decide that GMO is bad.
      Thus, it is in their best interest to be biased on this topic.
      Sure, so are many things.
      Therefore, the majority of the articles
      I've tried to grab here are by people who stand to gain in neither case
      or in both cases.  It's not perfect, but it's a way to help understand
      the possible veracity of the information.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>
I don't have a conclusion yet, but I have concerns, and a summary.
I can't conclude because, scientifically, the amount of information that I
can physically gather on the topic, and still work for a living, is
<i>way less</i> than what is required to understand with high confidence
what the facts are.
Alas, this is true for almost all of us.  (More - much more - on that topic
<A HREF="http://www.densmore.org/2013/debate.html">here</A>.) <BR> <BR>
To summarize, then ... sorry, it's a bit long.
</P>

There is a wealth of conflicting information out there, and I was easily able
to find data that conflicts with the assertion that GMO is harmful.
In order to be scientific, proposed theories must at least account
for all the data.
As far as I can tell, the danger theories don't account for all the data, for
example they don't account for the fact that there are no documented adverse
health effects from eating GE foods.
On the other hand, I can't easily determine the veracity of all the data
out there.
It <i>could be</i> that ALL the data saying GMO causes no harm is false.
It could be that ALL the data saying GMO is harmful is false.
More likely it is somewhere in between.
Nevertheless, until I see something written by people who have no monetary
stake in the outcome, which works to understand the veracity of the data,
which theorizes from a basis that accounts for all the likely-true data,
my assertion is that we basically have nothing but hype.

My take on virtually all these kinds of things is: yup, they can be used poorly, badly, dangerously, unhealthily (is that a word?).
I wish we didn't need regulations at all but we certainly do appear to need them for things like GMO and fracking - many other things too.
However, once the judgment is made that they can be used safely, can be used well, then companies have the right to try and make money from their innovations.
And that is what these technologies are, they are innovations.
We stifle innovation at our extreme peril.
I have spoken to a professional biologist on the subject of GMO.
His take is that it is completely safe if used properly, and the regulations can be written so that the innovation can be leveraged while maintaining safety.
Great! That's what I want.
Virtually every tomato we eat, almost all the corn we eat, is GMO, and we've been doing this for so long it's hard to say it's unsafe now, don't you think? Turning to fracking, I've spoken to professionals in the oil industry.
They say that when frackers follow the regulations, it is quite safe.
Moreover, they don't want to screw up the water table or the oil any more than we want them to - it is <I>incredibly</I> bad for business! So let's ensure they abide by the regulations in place! Most incidents of which one gentleman was aware were regulation violations.
Hopefully they resulted in improvements to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
A thing that Pisses Me Off is when a company doesn't follow the regs (especially on purpose) and gets little or no punishment.
THAT's when I get torqued.
I may not like all the regulations, but the system is what it is, you can't have everything.
Isn't what we really want:
<OL>
<LI>knowledgeable, objective people writing minimal regulation and</LI>
<LI>sensible, fair, but hard line enforcement of those regulations?<BR>(PS: It seems to me that neither of these objectives are important to Obama.
If so, then this is him shirking his fundamental job as Chief Executive!)</LI>
</OL>
And do we really want to prohibit innovation?
I work for a HUGE company.
I own a bit of stock in my company.
It and many other companies' entire business is innovation.
Corporate taxes - the highest in the world - could be on the ragged edge of pushing such large companies out of this country entirely.
When you rag on large companies, you rag on the entities that give most of our populace jobs.
When you rag on innovation, you rag on the life force that permits these companies to draw a profit.
I'm just not sure that's what we want to do! I think we can have a far more reasoned and thoughtful discussion about it than that.

my employer ;-)
