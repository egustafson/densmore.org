<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following, written in late February 2013, is a response
to a dialog that has occurred on <span class=SpellE>Facebook</span> over the
past few days, which began with a question about what it might take to change
Fox News, whether they always will maintain their ” .. <span class=GramE>ahem
..</span> <span class=GramE>’Fair and Balanced programming’”.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My colleagues on The Debate Space (A <span
class=SpellE>Facebook</span> group to which I occasionally contribute) believe
strongly that they have facts behind them, and perhaps think that I’m just a
rightwing nut.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Well ..</span>
I am a bit rightwing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Giving up the
debate was a serious consideration, because it had reached a point where, in
order to respond properly, that is to say in a reasoned fashion that retains
respect for my fellow debaters, I needed to do a fair bit of reading and
research.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover, there is always the
concern that even if I did this work, I may well still convince no one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And finally, I knew that the amount of
research that I could possibly do was well short of what is needed to provide a
thorough and objective response.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,
I personally have become extremely concerned about where my country is headed
politically.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have become more willing
to try convincing people of my point of view in reasoned, not-too-emotional
debates, even when my probability of success is low.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a patriotic thing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This response is the lengthy result of my
effort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its length is partly because the
text is not yet tight, but even more work on my part would be needed to make it
so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Honestly, when I wrote this, I did
not know what I would find with any confidence, and I went into it wanting to
be as objective as possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hopefully
my debate colleagues will bear with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SUMMARY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Much more detail is below, but because it is lengthy I
provide a summary here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I reviewed three
of the seven referenced surveys to try and understand objectively my confidence
in their results.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I found that each
survey points to an assumed <span class=GramE>truth,</span> and then states
that Fox News viewers are most likely to disagree with this assumed truth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed, if the assumed truth is true, these
Fox News viewers are misinformed, which is the assertion that was made.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the accuracy of this assertion in
each survey depends on the assumed truth being true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if it is not true?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Link 2, it is straightforward to show that the assumed
truth that no ”death panels” exist in the <span class=SpellE>ObamaCare</span>
legislation is at worst incorrect, and is at best highly ambiguous.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore someone who is questioning the
truth of the Administration’s assertions about the law in this regard is not
misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is properly questioning,
to try and find the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Link 7, I showed that the global warming facts on which
the survey hinges are in doubt and therefore are being subject to scientific
review, but that the politics of the situation are hindering progress on the
reviews.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, since the survey hinges
on this assumed truth, the outcome of the survey as to who is actually
”misinformed” is in question until there is again scientific agreement on the
degree of human contribution to global warming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Link 5, the study is shown to depend on a circular
argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s crafted carefully to hide
the circle, but it’s circular nonetheless.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No one can draw valid logical conclusions from a circular argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what is Fair and Balanced Programming?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Fox News’ programming raises issues where
a substantial portion of the American populace believes something their
government is telling them is fact, and Fox uncovers information that casts
doubt on the efficacy of these facts, it seems fair and balanced to me to
report on that information, even if other news agencies decline to do so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My opinion as to the identity of the
misinformed citizen is the citizen who does not listen to arguments on both
sides in order to make his decision about the truth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The truth is exceedingly difficult to discover;
nearly everyone has an agenda coloring it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you listen <span class=GramE>Only</span> to Fox, you’re probably
misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you listen Only to CNN,
Only to MSNBC, Only to CBS, you are probably misinformed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fair and Balanced is just a logo, just like
Hope and Change is a logo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My debate
colleague asserted with claims of proof from several studies that Fox News is <span
class=GramE>more ”</span>in the misinformation industry” than others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I successfully refuted - that is, cast
substantial doubt on - three of the seven surveys, in fact the first three I
investigated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point I stopped
investigating further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>POINTS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reading I did, and wrote about below, brought to the
forefront several important points.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Since I used them more than once, I introduce those points here:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Point 1.</span> The internet has become a
“chaotic information source”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This means
that for those who do not understand the rigorous definition of proof and how
disciplined one must be to obtain real proof, one can ”prove” almost any
assertion using internet resources.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, on the internet, it is straightforward to find an enormous amount of
information that persuasively draws the conclusion that humans are a prominent cause
of climate change on this Earth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is
also straightforward to find lots of information that makes very compelling the
notion that human-caused contributions are, in the aggregate, a completely trivial
contributor to overall climate change.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
which is it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What makes one large
collection of information more factual than the other large collection?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When debaters find most or all of <span
class=GramE>their ”</span>evidence” on the internet, reasoned and logical
dialog may well be extremely difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They could well find, upon further research, that much of their evidence
is not real evidence - that is not true, or at least possibly false.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since it’s very difficult and expensive these
days to avoid using the internet for most of one’s research, the inescapable
conclusion is that the information sources must be analyzed also, not just the
source’s content.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have to be
suspicious of everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Point 2.</span> Correlation is <span
class=GramE>Not</span> cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To expand,
this means that if you discover a correlation, even a strong one, between two
events, you cannot a priori assume that one of the events causes the other
event.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All too often, one later finds
some other, different cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Point 3.</span> One cannot draw
conclusions and call them facts if the premises used to derive the conclusions
are false or in question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course,
it’s common in politics these days to cite a premise as though it is true, even
when the premise is *known* to be false.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As soon as the reader fails to question the premise, she can
persuasively be led down a path to a false conclusion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can be really difficult to find false
premises; the careful investigator must be on the lookout for them all the
time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>Point 4.</span> No one can declare a
complex prediction true or false.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Relying on complex predictions is very precarious business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Simple prediction: the Sun will rise
tomorrow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed, there is a huge body
of scientific evidence and data one can point to <span class=SpellE>to</span>
conclude that this will occur.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Complex
prediction: the value of gold will continue to rise for the next 3 years at
least.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lot of investors are saying
this today, but they have been wrong before, and they will be wrong again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you don’t understand the nature of the
complexities that cause huge uncertainty in complex predictions, read The Black
Swan, it’s a great book.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bottom line
is<span class=GramE>,</span> our economy, for example, is so complex that it is
beyond the state of the art in science to understand it sufficiently to
reliably make complex predictions about the future.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, scientists serving politicians
often do not want you to know this!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
does not make it less true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(By the way,
this is an area where I am, in fact, an acknowledged expert in my
industry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know what I’m talking
about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Complex predictions are often
little more than faith-based opinions.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ok.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s start with
the premise of the main article so that we have the proper background.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It says that Fox News viewers are “The Most
Misinformed”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’ll take that to mean
that Fox News viewers are more misinformed than viewers who predominantly watch
other news sources like CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and perhaps a few others, I
hope that’s ok.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now let’s turn to the
word misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believe everyone in
our debate agreed on the meaning of this word, which is that those who are
misinformed believe statements to be true which turn out to be false (or vice
versa).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A requirement is that the
statements in question must clearly not be opinions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two people can have a different opinion and
neither is misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two people can
be armed with the same set of facts, have arrived at different conclusions -
opinions - from those facts, and still not be misinformed, unless one of the
conclusions actually, unequivocally, logically derives from the facts at
hand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a great many cases in politics,
neither conclusion drawn by two people with different views has this
property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A simple example of someone
who is misinformed is the person who believes that it is a fact that 2x2 is
5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since it has been proven that 2x2 is
4 (btw, this is a remarkably difficult proof requiring use of the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra), we can say confidently that the person is misinformed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, if you read the dialog, you discover that the debate
is hinging on whether the information in the surveys permit one to derive as
fact that Fox News viewers are more misinformed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s trivially easy for me to stop the debate right here
with the following, but rest assured I will not take this route. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This route is a cop out, but it is true
nonetheless.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The route I could use is to
leverage Point 2 that Correlation is <span class=GramE>Not</span> cause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The conclusion drawn is that Fox viewers are
more misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Period.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the articles point to a small subset
of the available information out there in the universe, that is, information on
these five topics: global warming, health care, a mosque in <st1:City w:st="on">New
 York City</st1:City> (ground zero), the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> war, and the 2010 election.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The surveys collectively conclude that on
those five topics, Fox viewers are more misinformed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let us suppose for a moment that this is
true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately for Mr. Mooney, it
does not follow from this that Fox viewers are more misinformed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Correlation can easily persuade someone that
since, on the 5 important topics referenced, Fox viewers are more misinformed
than other viewers, it follows that on some significant majority of topics, Fox
viewers are more misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
simply not the case, because that bit of correlation offers no insight
whatsoever on the degree of misinformation with which Fox viewers vs. other
viewers are endowed on the very next topic you might choose.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, in the extreme, it is possible - no,
I do not think it would be likely because these are significant issues of the
day - but it is nonetheless possible that Mr. Mooney managed to pick the only
five topics in the universe in which Fox viewers are more misinformed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He draws the general conclusion anyway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are many, many more significant issues
of the day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if on these topics Fox
viewers are more misinformed, there simply are no grounds to conclude that Fox
viewers are more misinformed in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LINK 1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Link 1: I believe that despite the above paragraph, in order
to be convincing and compelling I must address at least several of the surveys,
so I will do so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately, I cannot

valid location on the web.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LINK 2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Link 2 addresses health care, in particular, the law we
commonly know as <span class=SpellE>ObamaCare</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh my what a nightmarish place to start; I
say this because of Point 1: you <span class=GramE>can ”</span>prove” anything
on the internet, but let’s see what we can do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is complicated by the fact that the legislation itself is enormous,
ambiguous, context-sensitive (contains references to other information you need
to know to make sense of it), and it is self contradictory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you don’t believe that, go start reading
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, I haven’t finished it!<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Link 2 talks about 10 statements associated
with <span class=SpellE>ObamaCare</span>, <span class=GramE>declares</span> 5
true and 5 false, and then references various statistics associated with
respondents who were polled about the truth of each statement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I chose to start with the false
statements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Statement 6<span class=GramE>: ”</span>Allows a government
panel to make decisions about the end-of-life care for people on Medicare.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The survey declares that this statement is
false.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Essentially, this is a reference
to the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need some information from that chaotic
information source, the internet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s
refer to the links as 2.6.1-2.6.3:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.6.1: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Payment_Advisory_Board">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Payment_Advisory_Board</a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.6.2: <a

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.6.3: <a

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2.6.1, we learn what the IPAB is.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I defy anyone to read <span class=SpellE>ObamaCare</span>
with sufficient care to determine for sure that <span class=SpellE>wikipedia’s</span>
description is correct, but let’s assume that it is.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In particular, I invite you to read the
section on Predicted Outcomes, where a list of benefits is cited.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These are the outcomes the Obama
Administration wants you to believe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,
we must be cautious: these benefits form a complex prediction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I refer you to Point 4 above.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2.6.2 and 2.6.3 indicate that one can use the
same law to predict a different, less sanguine set of future outcomes, in
particular that IPAB will be required to ration health care resources to reign
in the otherwise exploding cost of Medicare, which will otherwise swamp the
federal budget.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, in 2.6.3 we
learn that this alternate prediction comes from, among others, a former advisor
to Obama, Steven <span class=SpellE>Rattner</span>, while writing in the New
York Times last September.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(In fact, he
even called it Death Panels!)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seems to
me this is an expert witness, a person who even is biased to downplay death
panels even if he knows that they’re in the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So which is it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Death panels or no?</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The answer <span class=GramE>is .</span> . NEITHER.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both are valid, possible, but complex,
predictions from the available facts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Neither is provably true or false, because they are complex predictions
of a future that has not yet occurred.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is sufficient complexity that no one can know with any confidence
at all which prediction might eventually come true, or if another outcome not
predicted yet will occur instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So our survey starts with a false premise: that there <span
class=GramE>are no death</span> panels in <span class=SpellE>ObamaCare</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In reality, a reasonable and possible outcome
of the law is IPAB-directed health care rationing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We can draw no conclusion about whether Fox
viewers are misinformed about the death panels statement, because since it is a
complex prediction, we cannot yet know whether the statement will be true or
false.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s turn to statement 7: Allow undocumented immigrants to
receive financial help from the government to buy health insurance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Statement 7, says the survey, is false.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For this statement we need the following

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.7.1 <span class=GramE>is</span> a <span class=SpellE>youtube</span>
<span class=SpellE>vid</span> where Rep. Sheila Jackson declares that <span
class=SpellE>ObamaCare</span> will allow undocumented immigrants to receive aid
to buy health insurance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a
democrat telling us that Statement 7 is true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is a great example of a chaotic information source.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you stop and consider very carefully, it
might occur to you to look at the date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Turns out the <span class=SpellE>vid</span> was recorded in 2009.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is in advance of the law’s passage!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore she is predicting a future at
recording time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you don’t know this,
and you don’t think to look at the date, this <span class=SpellE>vid</span> is pretty
conclusive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I watched this <span
class=SpellE>vid</span>, I had the up-then-down that you might imagine I had -
oh, this is definitely <span class=GramE>proof<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>..</span> .. <span class=GramE>oh</span>, wait, it’s not, the <span
class=SpellE>vid</span> was recorded in 2009.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This example makes clear, I <span class=GramE>hope,</span> how difficult
it is to know anything with any certainty anymore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is true on both sides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moving on, 2.7.2 declares that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_immigrant_population_of_the_United_States"
title="Undocumented immigrant population of the United States"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>illegal

exempt from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_mandate"
title="Health insurance mandate"><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Emergency
Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act</span></a> (EMTALA).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2.7.3 <span class=GramE>also</span> says most
of this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But 2.7.3 and 2.7.4 reveal
something else: that the Administration itself states that the law provides
grants to community health centers <span class=GramE>who</span> do and will
provide free medical services to low income and/or uninsured people, including
undocumented people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do we have to go on about Statement 7?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Regarding this survey, I chose my first
statement, did some research, and was able to satisfy myself objectively that
the assertion that it is false is strongly in question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I chose a second statement, and came to the
same conclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Granted, there are
eight more, and to be thorough I should look at them also.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, it has taken me 3 hours to get here
and I have many more surveys.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that
this is already more time than most people can even afford to spend doing
something like this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My wife, for
example, has a full time job and is taking a nearly full class load at a local
college.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the workload a lot of
people have, particularly those at a low income level working multiple
jobs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do they do research like this
to really understand what is going on?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My assertion - I won’t go about trying to prove it - is they don’t.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, for now, I’m going to move on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems pretty likely to me that more
thorough research would be likely to call most of this survey (Link 2) into
question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LINK 7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ok, what survey should I look at next?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can’t resist, I’m going to look at Link 7,
the one referred to as the new one vindicating Jon Stewart.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After all, the blog says that this one is a
tour-de-force<span class=GramE>! ..</span> .. .. <span class=GramE>and</span>
indeed, it is methodical, contains a mountain of references, lots of math and
statistics, and it’s enormous, it goes on and on, piling data on data on
data.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lot of work was done, and the
paper shows it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, the paper takes as a fact anthropogenic global
warming (AGW) of our planet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It then
draws extensive correlations between those who believe in AGW and their media
viewing habits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The paper’s authors find
very troubling the number of people in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> who do not believe in
AGW.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It notes the high numbers of such
people who watch, for example, Fox News.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The case they make is most compelling, though it cannot be entirely
conclusive due to Point 2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, that
lack of certainty in their conclusion is not my concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The paper crucially hinges on a single assertion: that there
really is significant AGW.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More
specifically, they assert <span class=GramE>that ”</span>within the scientific
community, broad international agreement has been reached about the reality and
human causes of global climate change”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Of all the 50 or more references in the paper, there is only one on this
topic<span class=GramE>, ”</span>IPCC”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
written in 2007 whose title is Summary for Policymakers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to this assertion, there are three
possibilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&gt; The assertion
is true (in which case Fox News viewers are misinformed)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&gt; The assertion
is false (in which case those misinformed are CNN and MSNBC viewers)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&gt; Despite the
claims that broad international agreement has been reached, we don’t actually
know the truth of the assertion; the jury, as it were, is still out; if this is
the case, then we still do not know who is misinformed, regardless of the
paper’s claims, and we can argue that no viewer is misinformed on the topic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So humor me for a minute if you happen to be someone who
believes in AGW.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s take a look at
the only information source to which I have easy access again, that chaotic
information source, the internet.</p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.1 refutes IPCC claims about global warming’s effect on
Earth’s ecosystems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is performed by
scientists, Ph.D.’s in their fields, and their fields of expertise are
applicable to the study.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.2 is an interesting, open discussion among scientists
about whether there is broad consensus in these climate change results.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One amusing aspect is a concept called cherry
picking, that is, selecting a subset of the available information and ignoring
the rest, in order to ”prove” a point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>To be sure, cherry picking is unethical and bad science.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trick is figuring out who is cherry
picking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes everybody is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.3 is a NASA study, done by NASA scientists, in which a
collection of observations shows a positive feedback loop regarding water vapor
and atmospheric warming, namely that warming produces more humidity, and since
water vapor is known to be Earth’s most abundant greenhouse gas, this adds to
the atmospheric warming.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, it
feeds on itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.4 is a description of studies in which experiments show a
negative feedback loop regarding water vapor and atmospheric warming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The experimental data is clearly at odds with
the experimental data in 7.3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Scientific
studies can be very difficult to follow, but this one isn’t.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Read it, the data is crystal clear. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In fact, it corresponds with our experience:
cities in dry climates are hotter, other things being equal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can 7.3 and 7.4 both be true?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s easy: both were experiments, so unless
people are falsifying data (see 7.6, but nonetheless I doubt that), then yes, both
are true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, before we draw
ultimate conclusions from either set of data, scientists must reconcile these
data and understand the processes at work that appear to create a contradiction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an inescapable logical conclusion
from the observations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately,
this has not yet been done.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These
studies are recent, there just hasn’t yet been time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, there is incomplete understanding
in the scientific community of what is going on scientifically, regardless of
anything the IPCC might say.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another 7.4
makes is that if the data in 7.3 is true in general, our planet must be much
hotter today than it actually is, due to the positive feedback loop.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet that’s not the case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, we need to reconcile the data before
we draw ultimate conclusions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.5 <span class=GramE>is</span> referenced by 7.4.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I mention it partly because it reminds us
that as recently as the 1970s, scientists were telling us so very strongly that
the concern was not global warming; rather, it was global cooling. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This again points to contradictions in the
data that are simply not adequately resolved yet by science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could go on, but again, this has taken hours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is so much more to understand, but no
layman can possibly perform the effort with enough thoroughness.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What any layman can see is that there may not
be a consensus at all, as Link 7 claims.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Furthermore, there are some persuasive scientific data that refute <span
class=SpellE>IPCC’s</span> claims.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Data
is the most powerful evidence that there is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It trumps mathematical models, and it certainly trumps expert
opinions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All that models and opinions
are good for is telling scientists where to gather data.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That data in these studies conflicts with <span
class=SpellE>IPCC’s</span> results must be accounted <span class=GramE>for,</span>
and it has not been.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The endeavor to
understand what’s happening simply is not scientific until that’s done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.6 <span class=GramE>is</span> troubling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In mid 2012 it was all over the news that
substantial amounts of data associated with climate change, and that
purportedly was strong evidence of AGW, was faked data.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without going into details, data used by the
IPCC in 2007 so that they could arrive at their conclusions is now called into
serious question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Link 7 was completed
in 2011, and so predates this troubling information about the faked data.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>7.6 also <span class=GramE>outlines</span>
strong motivation for faking data: there is much money to be made if AGW is
significant, and very little money to be made if AGW is not significant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You know what the movie says, Follow <span
class=GramE>The</span> Money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A quote
from 7.6: ”The real cutting edge in climate science was publicly exposed
recently in a book by one of the long time leaders of the German environmental
movement, Fritz <span class=SpellE>Vahrenholt</span>, in his new book, <em>The
Cold Sun</em>. The book expresses the growing concern among more careful real
climate scientists, rather than political scientists, that trends in solar
activity portend a return to the cold, limited agricultural output, and
widespread disease of the Little Ice Age, or even a more full blown, overdue by
historical standards, real ice age.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Wait.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You mean some of these
scientists expressing conclusions about AGW in IPCC are not real climate
scientists?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of what value are
conclusions from scientists who are not in the field?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Surely that’s a legitimate question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, it is clear that there is real doubt: IPCC had
political motivations; only a small subset of IPCC scientists are climate
specialists; we have a clear record of faked data; and we have climate
specialists who offer data in contradiction to the <span class=SpellE>IPCC’s</span>
findings, which has not yet been explained.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The last point is the strongest; it’s all about the data.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It quickly becomes clear that no one but an
honest climate scientist who has the wherewithal to maintain the necessary
knowledge in his field can understand which data is real, which is faked, how
much international consensus there really is, whether it is political or not,
whether it is financially motivated or not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As a group funded by nations’ governments, the IPCC collectively have
the financial motivation and the political means to lie about climate change consensus.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most importantly, they have some climate
scientists contributing to the IPCC body of work, but a great many of the
scientists contributing to those results are not climate specialists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe it is entirely reasonable to conclude from this information
that no layman can yet know whether AGW is actually significant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That being the case, asserting that Fox News
viewers are misinformed on the topic is specious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You see, what’s crucial here is that the
authors of Link 7 also do not know whether AGW is true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They made no effort to understand the
controversy in any detail or explain these details in their paper; many of these
details do predate their paper’s completion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Instead, they assumed that AGW is truth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Yet if that turns out to be a false premise of their paper, it
undermines the entire paper!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That this
does not concern them and they wrote and published the paper anyway is
completely damning of their scientific objectivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bottom line is, while science might know the answer,
politically the collective inhabitants of Earth do not yet know whether AGW is
significant, even if many of them have decided (erroneously) that they do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Writing a paper assuming that it is true is
ridiculous; since the whole paper hinges on it, the paper means nothing unless the
authors at least address the truth of the AGW assertion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LINK 5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ugh.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’ve just
discovered that the War and Election links are also written by
WorldPublicOpinion.org, same as Link 7.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I will now have to beat down my immediate reactions, which are (1) last
time their paper was long and difficult to read and understand, and (2) last
time they based their entire paper on what may well be a false assertion, and
while they had an opportunity to address that issue they did not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So why bother studying this one?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ok, the reason to bother is not all of my readers will feel
this way; they are predisposed to believe that the assumed facts listed are
actual facts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I press on with this one
additional link.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ah, but in fact, this link is easy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They gave away their bias right up front in a
section called A Note on the Question of What is ’True’.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently they were listening to my issues
with Link 7.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let us read exactly what
they write on this subject.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>”In the course of this study, to identify ’misinformation’
among voters, we used as reference points the conclusions of key government
agencies that are run by professional experts and have a strong reputation for
being immune to partisan influences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These
include the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Commerce, and the
National Academy of Sciences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also
noted efforts to survey elite opinion, such as the regular survey of economists
conducted by the Wall Street Journal; however, we only used this as supporting
evidence for what constitutes expert opinion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me break that down for you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The study authors decided to endow the CBO,
DOC and NAS, all institutions funded by the government, with <span class=GramE>a
”</span>strong reputation for being immune to partisan influences”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’ve become a student of these things in the
past five years, and I can assure you that no such reputation is deserved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe democrats feel that way about these
institutions, but most republicans don’t, and there is good reason, they
misstate and exaggerate all the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The authors’ entire study, then, rests on their opinion that these
institutions are above reproach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
results in a circular argument!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
issues addressed in the remainder of the study are less likely to be valid
unless these institutions are above reproach!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The second sentence above, that mentions the WSJ, is just funny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It says that if independent institutions
provide evidence supporting our opinion, then we include it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>JERKS.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>May I assume, then, that if they provide
evidence that does not support the study authors’ opinions, then they did not
include that evidence?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think it likely
so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does this fundamental logic error manifest itself in the
rest of the paper?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s see.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>”Effect of Stimulus
Legislation”.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>CBO and WSJ
produced studies saying that the stimulus legislation increased the number of
full time-equivalent jobs by 2.0 to 5.2 million compared to what those amounts
would have been otherwise.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The study
cites this as evidence that the Fox News viewer who believes the Stimulus did
little for jobs is misinformed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
that’s just not the case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, this is
a complex prediction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we’ve
previously discussed, even experts cannot reliably predict a complex
future.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Secondly, the 2.0-5.2m number is
not compared to the huge Stimulus cost of achieving those job numbers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Third, the 2.0-5.2m number is not compared to
the job growth we actually need in order to have a recovering economy (it’s a
lot more).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fourth, we have data - data!
- <span class=GramE>from</span> previous recessions that clearly show that a
null response (government does nothing or very little) can and does allow an
economy to recover much sooner than ours is recovering (which is, as yet, not
at all, despite the Stimulus.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>See here:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>5.1 talks about the severity of the
recession in 1907, which was significantly worse than 2008.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It talks about changes in complexity (2008
has higher complexity, faster speed, and greater scale) but fails to conclude -
because no one can, it’s too complex to understand - what impact these
complexity increases have on the situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(There’s an underlying lesson, though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If people are informed about history and they have political motivation,
like power, to ignore the lessons to be learned from that history, then they
probably will find plenty of excuses to do so!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.2 <span class=GramE>indicates</span> that the panic and
recession lasted about a year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the
recession was worse, but it recovered in a year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Teddy Roosevelt basically did nothing and
allowed the market to recover on its own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Our current recession hasn’t recovered yet by most any measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I rest my case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Link 5 is another example of a false, or at least not provably true,
premise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If their premise turns out to
be false, and we will not know this until well after the economy recovers, then
the Fox News viewers were not misinformed after all.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is folly to declare them misinformed now,
because we’re talking about opinions, even expert opinions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not, alas, facts.</p>

science. In these six surveys, questions about current events were sent to each

manipulative, and it leads to a viewer base who are full of opinions, full of
misinformation, and ready to exercise those misinformed opinions on the
political field. This is the problem with FOX. They've got a massive

class=uficommentbody>It's <span class=GramE>true,</span> I think bias is
present in every news media. For example, I know that all news media stations
are sensationally bias, and I'm willing to concede that many other
organizations have political <span class=GramE>bias's</span> as well. Why I
think <a href="https://www.facebook.com/warren.smelcer" target="_blank">Warren</a>
singled out Fox news is the fact that Fox isn't just bias, it has a
conservative agenda. Fox isn't just leaning a certain way, its working towards
the right. Furthermore, while other networks may misinform viewers, according
to the top two fact-checkers today Fox is #1 in the misinformation industry.
This is the issue with Fox.</span></p>

class=uficommentbody>Some of the assertions Aidan has made that he claims as
facts are actually opinions. No evidence presented to back your assertion that
Fox viewers are misinformed, only opinions. Don't care if it's 6 studies or
106, the studies didn't present evidence, only opinions. The charge of
systemic, intentional deception &amp; manipulation also requires evidence. Show
me how &quot;most frequently incorrect&quot; is anything other than the opinion
of Politico/<span class=SpellE>Politifact</span> and those who answered the
surveys. Your issue with Fox appears to me to be your own left leaning bias.
I've seen nothing to back up your assertions but opinions. What's worse is that
you appear to believe that some of your opinions actually are facts. There are
few worse deceptions.</span></p>

class=uficommentbody>So you don't think surveys are scientific. Can you suggest
an alternative method to investigate the effects of various news networks on
their viewers?</span></p>

class=uficommentbody>I did not say that. A carefully done survey is scientific.
A survey asking whether respondents agree with an opinion, and concluding that
those who disagree with that opinion are MISINFORMED, is ridiculous. I didn't
look at everything but it appears that this is what the surveys cited did.</span></p>

investigating the effects of a news network on its viewers would be very

class=uficommentbody>But these surveys weren't your typical surveys. As I've
already stated, they weren't a collection of opinions. They were tests on
current events. Saying that this kind of questionnaire is &quot;just an
opinion&quot; is as ludicrous as suggesting that the fact that you got <span

<p class=MsoNormal>Point 5 (at the end here because I thought I was going to
use it, but didn’t, yet I still thought it important enough to keep): One must
watch definitions of words extremely carefully in modern politics.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are changed to suit and mislead.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, it is not unusual to hear
politicians refer these days to reducing the deficit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes this means that the deficit
yesterday was (illustrative values follow for clarity) $12, and now it is
$10.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is the normal meaning most
people understand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, sometimes
they mean that the deficit was originally going to go from $12 to $20 this
year, and now it is going to go from $12 to only $15 this year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A running joke among mathematicians is when
they are going to try second and third derivatives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(If you don’t understand, never mind.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another one I heard recently is that the debt
was going to be reduced by $15.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By
leaving off mention of any time period, the politician led people to believe
that the reduction was going to be $15 over a single year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the actual plan was to reduce the
debt by $15 over ten years, or $1.50 each year on average; very misleading.</p>
