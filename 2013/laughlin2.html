      Click on fly-ins, go to page 3, and look for Laughlin.</LI>
  <LI>Anyone can review my photos on my website -
      <A HREF="http://www.densmore.org/2013/laughlin/index.html">go here</A>.
      They are in a strange order for some reason I didn't quite figure out;
      the third row is the first one taken chronologically.</LI>
  <LI>If you wish high-resolution photos, email me -- jim_at_densmore.org --
      and I will be happy to send as long as you plan no commercial use.</LI>
  <LI>I also posted a few photos to Facebook, some taken with my other camera,
      an iPhone.  Hopefully some of you had a chance to view them. </LI>
