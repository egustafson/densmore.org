      - - I guess some people are working hard to hide that there is cost
      shifting going on, but it's happening.
      Hospitals and doctors are becoming more reluctant to take those
      covered only by Medi{are,aid} because their cost is incompletely
      covered.
      From what my friend said, I think this is a significant part of what
      she was facing yesterday.

      - - here we have this nice article saying how over 100,000 residents
      of Colorado are going to benefit.
      My question: where's the money going to come from?
      Dr. Sowell asked recently: if we cannot afford to pay for our
      doctors, hospitals and medicines, then where will we get the money
      to pay for our doctors, hospitals, medicines <I>and</I> bureaucrats?
      Government controls costs by limiting payments.
      Mike pointed out to me - and I agree; perhaps you do also - that
      doing so stifles innovations that lower cost and improve quality.
      Therefore, the government takeover of health care payment authority 
      will inevitably result in lower quality/higher costs, as is happening
      to my friend.

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.ahip.org/Issues/Medicare-Advantage.aspx">Medicare funding issues article</A>
      - - Medicare funding issues are discussed herein, in particular
      the reduction in funding extant and forthcoming due to ACA.
      As the article states, CBO projects that ACA payment cuts alone will
      result in 3 million fewer Medicare Advantage enrollees.
      I don't think this is what happened to my friend, I think my
      friend was experiencing a Medicaid issue and cost shifting, but
      this information is worth a look also.

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/11/studies-show-medicaid-patients-have-worse-access-and-outcomes-than-the-privately-insured">Medicaid issues article</A>
      - - "Given these findings in the peer-reviewed literature, it is not
      surprising that Medicaid patients often arrive at emergency rooms
      in poor, and in many cases, untreatable condition.
      In fact, research has shown that Medicaid and CHIP patients end up
      in emergency rooms even more frequently than uninsured patients.[16]"
      ... ugh ... 'nuff said on this article.
