Sell me this pen.
I've seen a bunch of sales frameworks (I like

really well),
and I like <A HREF="

<LI>Find out how they last used that which you wish to sell (the pen), or something like it (pencil)
</LI>
<LI>Emphasize the importance of that activity where they used it
</LI>
<LI>Sell something bigger than the new pen - a state of mind, for example, and
</LI>
<LI>Ask for the buy - the close. (And, by the way, don't sell past the close!)

Here I can't easily ask after your coaching/consulting experience, but I am looking for another client.
I coach Agile including Scrum & Kanban, I coach/consult on software/systems architecture and organizational change, and I have ~40 years of applicable experience including real-time software development, telecom, & military simulations.

Coaching and consulting goes directly to your teams and your organization.
They're stuck in Waterfall? If they don't get unstuck, the products they build will suffer from poor feedback.
They're missing on requirements, building almost the right thing? They'll do poorly in the marketplace.
The architecture needs an update so you're not quite building the thing right? You may get a good start but you won't be able to keep up with the rapid pace of change.

And your teams contribute directly to your results.
When IT and Dev are aligned with your business, the value that accrues to you comes from what your teams develop right, and timely, and robustly.
You're either going to sell it, or you're going to use it to sell.
Either way we have to accountably connect your development organization to the value your teams will produce for the business.
</P> </LI>

<LI><P>
I need some work, and you need these improvements in your development organization, better
and quantifiable alignment to your business and architecture, and more rapid feedback
and modern process for your teams.
If we have a possible match, I'd love to hear from you.
