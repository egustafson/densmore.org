<P2>2019 180/185 Club Convention prep notes </P2>

<P>
A few photos/notes from our visit to Steamboat Springs yesterday 2017-07-16 (fly-in
breakfast), mostly these are from the 2006 Convention. Very interesting that the FBO
was easily able to find the photos and the attendee list. If you click on one of these,
use your browser "Back" button to return to this page.
