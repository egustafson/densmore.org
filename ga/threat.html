Perhaps this page is bland in appearance, but
I hope you will find its content less so.
Is it extravigantly sensationalist?
Only a month ago I myself would have thought so, though certainly at
that time I had concerns on this topic.
However, they were nothing like this.
Please read on.
<P>
The threat to general aviation - that segment of aviation that covers
everything other than scheduled airline travel, basically - is imminent.
That threat comes from our own government.
That threat includes rules that will violate our Constitutional rights.
It violates everything that I hold dear about our Country, the United
States of America.
It is much larger than GA.
Your favorite pastime is next.
If you do not exert control over your Legislators to stop this kind of
thing now, they will begin to control you, or permit the Executive Branch
to do so.
<P>
For now, let's just go with two items, the LASP, and a recent TSA
Security Directive.
<OL>
  <LI>
    The first item is the Large Aircraft Security Program, or LASP.
    This <A HREF="http://www.tsa.gov">Transportation Security Agency</A>
    program restricts the movements - even in an entirely domestic context -
    of aircraft weighing more than 12,500 pounds with scant justification,
    and does so in violation of our Constitution.
    From the detailed <A HREF="http://www.aopa.org">AOPA</A> comments to
    <A HREF="http://www.tsa.gov">TSA</A> on the proposed rule
    (<A HREF="http://download.aopa.org/epilot/2009/090226lasp_comments.pdf">see here</A>, it's a 48 page PDF, but the executive
    summary, well worth reading, is only a few pages long), we have
    the following:
    <P><BLOCKQUOTE>
    <FONT color="660000">
    Among the fundamental rights protected by the
    United States Constitution are the right to travel and the right to privacy.
    The Supreme Court has clearly stated that "freedom to travel throughout
    the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the
    Constitution."1
    The Supreme Court has been equally clear that the Constitution affords
    citizens with a fundamental right to privacy.2
    Congress has similarly held that "the right to privacy is a personal
    and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United
    States" and that, accordingly, "the right to privacy is directly
    affected by the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of
    personal information by Federal agencies."3
    These constitutional rights protect against overreaching government
    intrusion into the daily lives of citizens and the proposed rules
    should be sufficiently limited in scope and effect to avoid infringing
    on those rights.

    <P>
    There are so many other concerns in this rule, it is as though the TSA
    never bothered to learn anything about aviation at all.
    In fact, perhaps that's the case.
    <FONT color="000066">
    <UL>
      <LI>It applies commercial airline standards to general aviation operations, which is clearly against the intent of all aviation regulations from the FAA </LI>
      <LI>The weight threshold is ridiculous, they compare 12,500 pounds to
          airline aircraft, but the largest GA jets are 80,000 pounds, some
	  10 tons lighter than the smallest airlines like the 737</LI>
      <LI>The proposal outsources regulatory oversight, an inherently
          governmental function, to a third party audit</LI>
      <LI>The proposal is not tailored to any demonstrable security threat -
          by TSA's own admission </LI>
      <LI>The proposed watchlist raises serious and substantive privacy
          concerns by making every passenger on such an airplane subject
	  to a background check; the TSA already demonstrably is mis-
	  handling the information it has </LI>
      <LI>The proposal requires aircraft operators to actually submit
          a security program proposal to TSA for review </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
    and there are several others.
    Don't you think this will have an impact on the industry?
    On airports, the lifeblood of your town with respect to medium-
    and long-range transportation?
    Of course it will.
    Angry yet?
    But we haven't started!
    <P>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    The next item is far more threatening, though we, as yet, have little
    information about it.
    This is an <B>already implemented</B> security directive,
    <B><I>secretly</I></B> promulgated and already in effect.
    It is called Security Directive SD1542-08-04-F.
    It is not open for public comment under the guise that its specifics
    are <B>classified</B>.
    While we know little as yet, what we do know comes from the fact that
    some airports around the country are beginning to implement it.
    It would seem that this directive requires all airline airports to enforce
    a system whereby anyone who wants access to the operations area of the
    airport must pay for and have done on him a background check prior to
    continued the use of the airport, and obtain a security badge.
    Apparently due to immediate outcry from several aviation organizations,
    TSA has pushed the required implementation date back to June 1.
    Earlier, it was April 30, I believe.
    <P>
    In case the ramifications are not obvious, this means that if an owner
    of an aircraft based at an airline airport like
        Colorado Springs,
	Grand Junction,
	Pueblo,
	Lamar,
	Vail,
	or
	Alamosa
    will be required to get that background check.
    Many aircraft owners base their aircraft at airports such as this.
    450 airports nationwide serve airlines and all are affected.
    Nearly all serve general aviation aircraft, and most depend on
    general aviation aircraft to keep them vital.
    And if this owner wants to land his/her aircraft at another such
    airport, another background check is required for each such airport!
    This eliminates the utility of the aircraft.
    It will destroy most of these airports.
    You won't be able to catch an airliner out of Pueblo or Lamar, for example.
    Is this crazy and thoughtlessly crafted?
    <P>
    Moreover, is this substantially different than in Germany in the late
    '30s, depicted vilely in movies that you've all watched, where everyone
    is asked routinely for Travel Papers?
    If this becomes routine, how long before the same is required of you
    to travel down the interstate in your automobile?
    Tell me how it's different!
    I don't think it is.
    <P>
    It is tempting to rail merely against the stupidity of having to
    get multiple background checks.
    Do not succumb to this temptation.
    No form of this rule must be allowed to persist.
    It is a flagrant violation of our Constitutional rights and freedom.
    There is no substantial, credible reason for the rule to exist.
    We must fight it with every legal resource at our disposal.
    Failure to win this fight will make it harder to win other similar
    fights that will arise in the future throughout the land.
    The next one will affect your neighbor.
    Enlist that neighbor.
    No excuses.
    If the reasons are not obvious to you, I'll be glad to engage you
    in a dialogue about it.
    Let me hear your concerns,

    <P>
    Here are two links I'm aware of that speak to this issue.
    I'm sure there will be many more.

<P>
Please let this serve as an introduction to the threat of our own
government to General Aviation.
Please allow me to remind you that if you don't care about GA, you
still need to care about this.
Your favorite freedom is next. 
Guns perhaps? Or, more insidiously, ammo?
Recreational vehicles?
Motorcycles?
A second vacation home?
Who knows ...
<P>
If you have read this far, thanks very much for your time.
My personal opinion, for what it's worth.
