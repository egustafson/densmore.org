<BODY>
Thanks to Hank and Linda Fore, flying their 185 (9SA), we have some
excellent shots of 55A here, some in the air east of Meadow Lake,
taken in mid November 2002 on a great Colorado day.
<P>
We and the Fores were on our way to a breakfast meeting with other
180/185 owners in Pueblo, Colorado.
Would you like to see Hank and Linda's airplane as seen from ours?
Erik Mugele came with us and shot <A HREF="9SA.html">these photos</A>
of their beautiful machine.
