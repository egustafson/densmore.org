Here are some shots of Hank and Linda Fore's 185,
taken by Erik Mugele from 55A while we were on our
way to a breakfast meeting with other 180/185 owners.
The date was 16 November 2002, another great Colorado day.
Hank did a great job with the formation flying while I led.
We used the only film I had lying around, 400 ASA print film from Kodak.
The camera is my old but trusty and excellent Canon AE-1 with a 200mm zoom.
<P>
Would you like to see our airplane from Hank and Linda's?
The Fores shot <A HREF="flying55a.html">these photos</A> at the same time.
