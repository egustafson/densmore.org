In November 2002 we journeyed to Southern California to visit friends,
relatives and colleges during the week of Thanksgiving.
We were very fortunate to take along our steed, 55A, which make the trip much
shorter.

    <A HREF="http://www.cableairport.com">Cable Airport</A> in Upland.
    We parked the airplane here for the week.
    As near as I can tell, from the time we stopped basing the
    <A HREF="http://www.densmore.org/personal/55A">180</A> here
    in 1963, <B>Nothing has Changed</B>!
    It is still a beautiful little airport, enormously supportive of aviation.
    The same family still runs the airport, and they do it well.
    We even found 80 octane fuel!
<P><LI><A HREF="02.jpg">(pic) This picture</A> is of an
    <A HREF="http://www.warbirdalley.com/an2.htm">Antonov AN-2 "Colt"</A>
    biplane reposing at
    <A HREF="http://www.cableairport.com">Cable Airport</A>.
    <BR>According to John Poss, there are three sizes of all things:
    <UL><LI>Wee, <LI>Not so wee, <LI> and freakin' 'uge! (huge) </UL>
    well, this biplane is freakin' 'uge.
    Of course, that's my cousin Al Densmore looking really small next to
    the airplane.
<P><LI><A HREF="03.jpg">(pic) Another of the AN-2, indicates its size
    even better than the previous pic.</A>
    Cable Operations buildings are in the background.
    Some in the audience will recognize them.
<P><LI><A HREF="04.jpg">(pic) Another.</A>  That's me of course.

    We are at
    <A HREF="http://www.knotts.com">Knotts</A> Berry Farm.
    Can you believe it?
    This was literally a berry farm the first time I visited it as a very
    small child.
    not anymore!

    Oh wait, isn't that one of the kids in the truck?
<P><LI><A HREF="08.jpg">(pic) On the ramp at Scottsdale airport.</A>
    Very nice hotel here, good place to RON.
    But I'm not sure why I took this picture ...
<P><LI><A HREF="09.jpg">(pic) Linda and Katy and 55A</A>
    at Scottsdale.
    I know exactly why I took this picture, aren't they beautiful?
    Yeah I know, Linda's eyes are allergic to camera lenses.
<P><LI><A HREF="10.jpg">(pic) airborne out of Scottsdale</A> -- I forget the
    name of the lake, but we flew over this shortly after takeoff to the east
    of Scottsdale on the way home via ABQ.
    I took a number of shots in this area.
    I knew that no camera would capture the beauty of the scenery,
    maybe I just wanted to document that we'd flown by.

    She doesn't find flying to be exciting, I'm afraid, but was happy
    nonetheless to have a way for her family to easily accompany her to
    California to visit and prepare to select colleges, e.g.
    <A HREF="http://www.scrippscol.edu">Scripps</A>
    (my Mom's alma mater!),
    <A HREF="http://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer</A>, and
    <A HREF="http://www.oxy.edu">Occidental</A>.
    We have
    <A HREF="http://www.densmore.org/2002/CAtripNov">lots more pictures</A>
    of our visits to these colleges.

    We flew out to Lincoln to see Meg at a tri meet there at this pool.
    Meg swims for the
    <A HREF="http://www.uofl.edu">University of Louisville</A>
    as a freshman.
    She's got
    <A HREF="http://www.densmore.org/meg/1/index.html">a lot more pictures</A>
    of this meet, along with pictures of her training trip to Key West.
