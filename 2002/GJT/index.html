These are Jeff Larsen's pictures of our flight from Colorado Springs
to Grand Junction Colorado on 26 July 2002.
<P>
Goals:
<UL>
<LI>Watch our kids swim in the State meet
<LI>Recon Marble Colorado for future landing at small airport there
</UL>
Pictures are somewhat incomplete because Jeff had another (nondigital)
camera he also was using, and in which we have most of the pix.
But these are the ones from the digital.
