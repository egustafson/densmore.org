We are planning on holding the 180/185 Annual Convention on 24-28 June
2019 in Routt County's lovely ski resort town of Steamboat Springs, CO.
Some of you will recall having held our convention in Steamboat once
before, in the mid 2000s.
Some of the ground crew at the Steamboat Springs FBO were around last
time, including the lead ground crew guy, Mike.
He is already working with us to ensure a great fly-in.

<H3>Historical tidbits </H3>
<A HREF="http://familytravelcolorado.com/Steamboat_History.html">Steamboat Springs</A>
gets its name from a hot spring
whose rock formations whistled and chugged from the steam; trappers
heard this and gave the town its name.
While the rock formations were sacrificed to development activities,
the springs, river, snow, abundant trails and delightful climate
year-round mean that outdoor activities are king.

<A HREF="https://www.sofmag.com/air-force-legend-robin-olds-the-greatest-aerial-warrior-and-leader-in-american-history/">Robin Olds</A>
("Lead"), elite Viet Nam fighter wing CO and often considered the
greatest aerial warrior and leader in American history, made his home in
Steamboat after he retired.

<H3>Routing </H3>
<A HREF="http://www.flycolorado.org/index.php/resources/mountain-flying-basics/">Mountainous terrain</A>
 abounds near Steamboat Springs, but there are both east and west
routes to Steamboat that do not require altitudes over 10,000',
and few airplanes perform better in the mountains than ours.
Even the <A HREF="https://skyvector.com/?ll=39.956982078814015,-105.70120238798594&chart=301&zoom=2&fpl=%20KGNB%20undefined%20KSBS">Rollins Pass</A>
option can include only one short period at or slightly above 12,500'.
You may wish to plan to get close, and then leave from there early
to arrive at the kSBS Steamboat Springs airport before Noon, taking
advantage of the calmer weather usually found in the morning hours.

<P>
Bring your <A HREF="https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/pic-archive/pilot-and-passenger-physiology/oxygen-use-in-aviation">oxygen</A>
if you have it though, and please plan to bring your tiedown kits.
